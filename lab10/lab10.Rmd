# Today's plan

- Fuzzy RDD

- Multiple cutoffs and GRDD

- RDD and heterogeneity: Diff-in-disc

- Local randomization approach

- RDD for the effect of politician characteristics (PCRDD)



# Fuzzy RDD

Endogenous treatment take-up or non-compliance, but discontinuous change in treatment probability.

![](sharp_fuzzy.png)

# Fuzzy RDD

> - IV model where the treatment $D$ is endogenous and the cutoff rule gives the instrument. Under the usual IV assumptions:

$$\frac{\lim_{x \to c^+} E[Y_i|X=x] - \lim_{x \to c^-} E[Y_i|X=x]}{\lim_{x \to c^+} E[D_i|X=x] - \lim_{x \to c^-} E[D_i|X=x]} = \tau_{FRD}$$

> - Under heterogeneous TE and motonicity, $\tau_{FRD}$ has a LATE interpretation.

> - Estimation: once IV regression, today argument `fuzzy` in `rdrobust`


# Multi-score RDD

> - Treatment assignment depends on more than one RV
>   - School admission based on multiple test scores
>   - Policy eligibility based on more than one criteria
>   - Treatment based on being on a side of a boundary


# Multi-score RDD
Differences relative to standard RDD:

> - Continuity along both dimensions

> - Effect at every boundary point: a *treatment effect curve*

> - One could estimate the effect at different points of the boundary to characterize heterogeneity

# GRDD

> - Effect of geographic boundaries: a long interest of political science

> - Political/administrative boundaries

> - Media market boundaries

Challenges:

> - Compound treatments: many things change at the same boundary

> - Geographic sorting

> - Sparsity around the boundary

> - Non-exogeneity of the boundary

Example


# Difference-in-discontinuities

> - Add a dimension of heterogeneity (e.g. time) to RDD

> - Addresses problems of compound treatment if one of the treatments is introduced *after* the other

> - Estimate moderation effects
>   - Assumptions not very formalized

> - Usually standard regression models within a bandwidth, more parametric assumptions

# Local randomization

> - Alternative approach to RDD

> - Instead of continuity, assume random assignment in a neighborhood of the cutoff \pause

Given a window $W_0$ around the cutoff:

> - Distribution of RV in $W_0$ is known, the same for all units, and does not depend on the potential outcomes: $F_{X_i|X_i \in W_0}(x) = F(x)$

> - Inside $W_0$, the potential outcomes depend on the running variable solely through the treatment indicator $T_i = \mathbb{I}(X_i > c)$, but not directly: $Y_i(X_i, T_i) = Y_i(T_i) \forall i \text{s.t.} X_i \in W_0$ 

> - **More** restrictive than continuity, but finite sample inference methods


# Local randomization
![](locrand.png){height=85%}

# Local randomization

> - Estimation and inference with the package `rdlocrand`

> - Data-driven approach to find the window: specify pre-determined covariates, choose larger windows until T and C units are no longer balanced on them

> - Fisherian methods for inference: randomization inference for the sharp null

# Estimation

To choose the window, specify: 

> - Covariates to use for balance

> - Test statistic to use for balance (e.g. difference in means)

> - Randomization mechanism

> - Minimum no. observations in the smallest window

> - Significance level

> - Then, difference-in-means within the selected window + randomization inference
